This is a replica of the website tindog (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tindog.tindog&hl=en_US&gl=US) that I created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 
To run the website, download the website files and open "index.html" file in any web browser. While the website is currently limited to the front page, I plan to add more functionality to it in the future. Through this project, I have become extremely comfortable in working with containers, padding, margins, and the overall design process.
